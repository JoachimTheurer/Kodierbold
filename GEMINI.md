# Project Overview: "Der Kodierbold" - p5.js Learning Materials

This directory, "Der Kodierbold," contains a comprehensive set of German-language educational materials for learning creative coding using the p5.js JavaScript library. It appears to be structured as a series of lessons or a tutorial for beginners.

The project is not a single, runnable application but rather a collection of interconnected HTML documents, JavaScript code snippets, images, and text files that guide a user through the fundamentals of programming with p5.js. The primary method of interaction seems to be opening the HTML files in a web browser.

## Directory Structure and Purpose

The project is organized into four main directories:

*   `HTML/`: Contains the main lesson content. The central file is `index.html`, which serves as a table of contents, linking to various other HTML files that represent chapters or topics (e.g., `010.html`, `012.html`).
*   `Code/`: Holds the JavaScript (p5.js) code examples that correspond to the lessons. Files are numbered (e.g., `0000.js`, `0010.js`) to likely match the lesson numbers. The file `sketch.js` is a common starting point in p5.js projects.
*   `Bild/`: (German for "Image") Stores image files (mostly `.png`) used as illustrations and diagrams within the HTML lesson files. These images visualize concepts and the p5.js editor interface.
*   `Text/`: Contains supplementary text files, including a glossary (`0 - GLOSSAR.txt`), ideas, and drafts of the lesson content.

## Key Files

*   `HTML/index.html`: The main entry point and table of contents for the entire tutorial. Start here to navigate the lessons.
*   `Text/012 - Programmierumgebung.txt`: A key introductory document that explains the purpose of the project and directs users to the official p5.js web editor (`editor.p5js.org`).
*   `Code/*.js`: A series of p5.js sketches that serve as practical examples for the concepts taught in the lessons.
*   `HTML/*.html`: Individual lesson pages containing explanations and embedded images.

## How to Use This Directory

This directory is intended for educational purposes. To use it:

1.  Start by opening `HTML/index.html` in a web browser to see the table of contents.
2.  Navigate through the lessons (chapters) by clicking the links.
3.  The lessons will refer to code examples found in the `Code/` directory. It is intended that the user will copy this code into a p5.js environment, such as the recommended [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/), to run it and see the output.
